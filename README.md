# JavaScript Form Validation Project

This repository contains a form validation project developed during my training period, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates form validation functionality, providing real-time feedback based on user input.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to implement form validation using JavaScript. The project offers instant visual feedback, with fields turning green and displaying a valid message for correct input, or turning red with an error message for incorrect input. This project helped me understand user input validation techniques and interactive UI feedback using JavaScript.

## Features

- **Real-Time Form Validation**: Validates user input as they type, providing instant feedback.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Input fields change color and display messages based on the correctness of the user's input.
  - **Green Field**: Indicates valid input with a success message.
  - **Red Field**: Indicates invalid input with an error message.
- **JavaScript-Only Validation**: All validation logic is handled with JavaScript, without any backend integration.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
